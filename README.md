# chaos-is-a-tree
In machine learning, chaos isn't a ladder -- it's a tree. This notebook explores how decision trees transform chaos into clarity, one split at a time. See what happens when you scale up from a single tree to a full random forest. Inspired by Game of Thrones and powered by scikit-learnâ€™s wine dataset.
